# Chance Encounter
A meeting, destiny or chance?


## Description
My groupmate and I decided to film our encounter when we were randomly put into the same group and realized we had been living in the same building next to each other all this while. This project seeks to highlight the wholesomeness of that meeting.


## Process
After we realised that we had been living as next-door neighbours, we decided to recreate that encounter, film it, and then use it as the basis for our 30 Minute Film Festival Project. Since the meeting was over zoom, we both had to record our screens then combine both videos to create the film.

## Reflection
This was a really fun project to build in a sense that it not only made me a new friend, but also gave me the freedom to experiment with creating a website for a film. The final version the project came out as I intended and really taught me a lot.
