                Both Zaeem and Abdul are a second year Computer Science students at NYUAD. After being randomly assigned
                to work together on the 30 Minute Film Festival project, they realized they lived in the same building
                and on the same floor. As soon as they realized this, they filmed their reaction which was absolutely
                priceless. The video starts off with the regular 'college introduction' of 'what is your name ?', 'what
                is your major?', and 'what is your nationality?'. As soon as they started talking about the building in
                which they lived in and realized they lived right next to each other, the video trasitions into a
                pricelessly wholesome interaction.
